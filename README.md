# 🎧 Signal Processing Lab Projects

This repository contains implementations of various fundamental experiments and mini-projects performed as part of the **Signal Processing Lab**. These experiments focus on concepts such as **time-scaling**, **shifting**, **linear time-invariant (LTI) systems**, and **basic signal operations**, which are core to understanding **Signals and Systems**.
